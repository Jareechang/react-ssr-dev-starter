#### Motivation

This repo is mainly to create a playground for experimenting with react related things with SSR included.

A lot of existing frameworks have a lot of batteries included and are quite opinionated. They are not limited to:

- State sync between client / server
- Data fetching / loading
- Router
- Builds
- Templating 

Most of the time, these are built in and typically are quite difficult to swap out or deviate away to the approach offered by the framework.

So, it forces you to build apps in a certain way. For a good reason, which is optimized for production in a specific case.

However, this make it difficult to experiment / try out ideas with different techniques or optimize for edge cases.
